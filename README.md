Object-Relational Mapping ([ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectâ€“relational_mapping)) is a programming technique which connects objects to a relational database. ORM converts data between systems that they are not unable to communicate eachother without relational databases and OOP languages.
